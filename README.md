NFT Collection as its name suggested is Collection of 20 unique NFTs. The main difference is that I have created Whitelist contract earlier and using interface
Whitelist Contract and NFT Collection interact with each other. Whitelisted Addresses will have the option of Pre-minting. 
A special Presale feature only opened for them.
